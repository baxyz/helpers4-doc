# TODO List - Helpers4 Documentation

This file contains tasks and prompts for GitHub Copilot to help continue development of the Helpers4 documentation website.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. ü§ñ Automated API Documentation Generation
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Help me create an automated system to generate API documentation from the main Helpers4 library source code. The system should:
- Parse TypeScript source files and extract function signatures
- Extract JSDoc comments and convert to markdown
- Generate individual documentation pages for each helper function
- Update the sidebar navigation automatically
- Sync examples from test files
- Cross-reference related functions
- Validate documentation completeness

Current manual process needs automation to stay in sync with the main library at helpers4/helpers4.
```

### 2. üéÆ Enhanced Interactive Playground
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Improve the interactive playground in src/pages/playground.tsx to:
- Actually execute TypeScript code safely (using web workers or sandboxing)
- Provide real-time type checking and IntelliSense
- Include pre-built examples for each helper category
- Add sharing functionality for code snippets
- Implement code templates and snippets
- Add performance profiling for executed code
- Support importing and testing multiple helper functions

Current playground only simulates execution - need real TypeScript compilation and execution.
```

### 3. üì± Mobile Experience Enhancement
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Optimize the documentation website for mobile devices:
- Improve responsive design for all components
- Optimize the playground for touch interfaces
- Create mobile-friendly navigation patterns

- Test on various screen sizes and devices

Focus on the playground component and API documentation pages.
```

### 4. üîç Advanced Search Implementation
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Implement comprehensive search functionality:
- Set up Algolia DocSearch or alternative search solution
- Index all documentation content including API reference
- Add search within code examples
- Implement search result highlighting
